The 'grantpubcite' package can be used to query the [NIH Reporter][]
database for funded grants and, optionally, publications associated
with grants in NIH Reporter. The citation history of publications can
discovered using [iCite][].  The 'grantpubcite' package help pages and
resources make extensive use of 'tidyverse' concepts.

Core tidyverse functions used in the articles include:

- `tibble()` -- representation of a `data.frame`, with better display
  of long and wide data frames. `tribble()` constructs a tibble in a
  way that makes the relationship between data across rows more
  transparent.
- `glimpse()` -- providing a quick look into the columns and data in
  the tibble by transposing the tibble and display each 'column' on a
  single line.
- `select()` -- column selection.
- `filter()`, `slice()` -- row selection.
- `pull()` -- extract a single column as a vector.
- `mutate()` -- column transformation.
- `count()` -- count occurences in one or more columns.
- `arrange()` -- order rows by values in one or more columns.
- `distinct()` -- reduce a tibble to only unique rows.
- `group_by()` -- perform computations on groups defined by one or
  several columns.
- `summarize()` -- calculate summary statstics for groups.
- `left_join()`, `right_join()` -- merge two tibbles based on shared
  columns, preserving all rows in the first (`left_join()`) or second
  (`right_join()`) tibble.

In an interactive session, a useful way to visually navigate the
sometimes large tibbles is to use the [DT][] package, e.g.,
`DT::datatable(projects)`.

# Installation and loading

Install the development version of grantpubcite from [github][].

[github]: https://github.com/mtmorgan/grantpubcite

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!nzchar(system.file(package = "remotes")))
    install.package("remotes", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
remotes::install_github("mtmorgan/grantpubcite")
```

Load the library and other packages to be used in the vignette.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(grantpubcite)
```

# NIH Reporter projects

`reporter_projects()` queries the 'projects' endpoint; see the
technical description of the NIH Reporter [project search API][NIH
search] for details, paying particular attention to the 'schema'
present in the executable example..

[NIH search]: https://api.reporter.nih.gov/#!/Search/Projects

For illustration we start by identifying Funding Opportunity
Announcemments (FOA) that might be of interest, in this case current
FOA under the Information Technology in Cancer Research ([ITCR][])
program.

[ITCR]: https://itcr.cancer.gov/

```{r}
foas <- c(        # one or more criteria, e.g., foa number(s)
    "PAR-15-334", # ITCR (R21)”
    "PAR-15-332", # ITCR Early-Stage Development (U01)
    "PAR-15-331", # ITCR Advanced Development (U24)
    "PAR-15-333"  # ITCR Sustained Support (U24)
)
```

Use `reporter_projects()` by providing criteria to be used to query
the NIH Reporter projects endpoint. The criteria are provided as named
arguments to `reporter_projects()`. To query for projects awarded
under the FOA of interest, use the argument `foa =`. Initially, use
the `limit = 1` argument to retrieve just a single record.

```{r}
reporter_projects(foa = foas, limit = 1L) |>
    glimpse()
```

This shows that the return value of `reporter_projects()` is a
`tibble` (the tidyverse representation of a `data.frame`) with a
single row corresponding to the requested record, and all possible
fields returned by the query.

Inspect the fields for those that might be of interest, and define a
variable to reference these.

```{r}
include_fields <- c(
    "full_foa",
    "core_project_num",
    "fiscal_year",
    "award_amount",
    "contact_pi_name",
    "project_title",
    "project_start_date",
    "project_end_date"
)
```

Now execute the `reporter_projects()` query on all of our FOA of
interest, including only the fields of interest in the response.

```{r}
projects <- reporter_projects(foa = foas, include_fields = include_fields)
projects
```

# NIH Reporter publications

The NIH Reporter [publication search API][] provides a way to retrieve
publications reported as grant-supported. The search criteria are
complicated, but the return value is always a tibble with columns
`coreproject`, `pmid`, and `applid`. Here we search for all citations
from the projects funded by current ITCR FOAs.

[publication search API]: https://api.reporter.nih.gov/#!/Search/Publications

```{r}
core_project_nums <-
    pull(projects, "core_project_num") |>
    unique()
publications <- reporter_publications(core_project_nums = core_project_nums)
publications
```

Note that some projects were funded by previous ITCR FOA, so that
publications can appear to be from 'before' funding under the current
FOA.

# iCite publication citations

The NIH [iCite][] resource and [API][iCite API] can be used to map
PMID ids from NIH Reporter to detailed information about publications,
including citations and derived citation measures that account for,
e.g., time since publication.

[iCite API]: https://icite.od.nih.gov/api

Discover available fields by querying iCite using the first row of the
`publications` tibble obtained from NIH Reporter. `iCite()` takes as
its first argument any tibble, provided it has a column `pmid`.

```{r}
## which fields are available in icite?
icite(slice(publications, 1L)) |>
    glimpse()
```

Identify fields of interest, and query for all publications associated the

```{r}
include_fields <- c(
    "pmid", "year", "citation_count", "relative_citation_ratio",
    "doi"
)
icite(publications, include_fields)
```
