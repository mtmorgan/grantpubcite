# grantpubcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The 'grantpubcite' package is used to query the [NIH Reporter][]
database for funded grants and, optionally, publications associated
with grants in NIH Reporter. The citation history of publications can
discovered using [iCite][].  The 'grantpubcite' package help pages and
resources make extensive use of 'tidyverse' concepts.

Install the development version of grantpubcite from [github][].

[github]: https://github.com/mtmorgan/grantpubcite

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mtmorgan/grantpubcite")
```

Load the library and other packages to be used in the vignette.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(grantpubcite)
```

See

- [Get started][] for an introduction to the package.
- [Case study: ITCR][] for an illustration of package use analysing
  grants in the NIH Information in Technology in Cancer Research
  portfolio of grants.
