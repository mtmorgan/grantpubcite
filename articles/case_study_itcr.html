<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"></a>
</h2>
<p>Note that this is way outside my area of expertise, so I have
undoubtedly made terrible blunders.</p>
<p>The ‘grantpubcite’ package can be used to query the <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/" class="external-link">NIH Reporter</a> database for funded
grants and, optionally, publications associated with grants in NIH
Reporter. The citation history of publications can discovered using <a href="https://icite.od.nih.gov/" class="external-link">iCite</a>.</p>
<p>As a case study, suppose we are interested in grants funded under the
Information Technology in Cancer Research (<a href="https://itcr.cancer.gov/" class="external-link">ITCR</a>) program.</p>
<p>The <a href="#project-information">Project information</a> section
shows that I found 146 projects (a useful sanity check?). The first
figure shows that projects funded for more fiscal years received more
funding (not too surprising!). At this stage and subsequently I found it
useful, using the datatables on the web page, to search for ‘my’ project
(U24CA180996, Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Scalable Solutions in
R/Bioconductor) and compare how we were doing relative to other
projects. Frankly, I did not know where we stood; now I do.</p>
<p>I then focused on projects receiving funding in 2020.</p>
<p>The <a href="#maturing-projects">Maturing projects?</a> subsection
uses project title and contact PI to ask whether projects graduate
between funding activities. One (Campbell) has matured from ‘Innovative’
to ‘Early-Stage’, three Griffith, Karchin, and Liu) have matured from
‘Early-stage’ to ‘Advanced’, and tow have matured from ‘Advanced’ to
‘Sustained’. I was a little disappointed that there were not more
smaller projects maturing.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#publications">Publications</a> section, we see a
positive relationship between funding (amount or duration) and
publication. Again this is not surprising, but speaks to the notion that
scientific software projects are playing by the same rules as ‘wet lab’
projects; it would be interesting to identify a comparable wet-lab
program for comparison. There are some outliers, including one project
with a surprisingly large number of publications for the period of the
grant, as well as projects with only a handful of publications even
after multiple years of funding. The <a href="#itcr-collaboration">ITCR
collaboration</a> section shows that 15 projects collaborated closely
enough with each other to be acknowledged in the same publication.</p>
<p>The figure in the <a href="#citations">Citations</a> section shows
what I imagine is a pretty typical pattern, with most publications
having moderate (&lt;100) citations, and a few having many citations.
Scanning the datatable immediately below the figure indicates that the
highly cited publications are biologically driven, where the paper
authors have presumably cited the relevant software; the three
most-cited publications are all from U24CA180922, which funds the
Trinity software. When I look at the five most highly cited of ‘my’
project publications (U24CA180996), they are more modestly successful
(181 to 337 citations); interestingly, 4 of the 5 publications emphasize
software per se, rather than strictly biological insight.</p>
<p>The <a href="#itcr-collaborations">ITCR collaborations</a> subsection
takes a second look at collaboration, in the sense of ITCR projects
citing the works of one another. 38 projects cite work of 30 other
projects.</p>

<p>The result is a tidyverse <code>tibble</code>, and we use ‘tidy’
semantics to explore the data. There are 443 returned by NIH Reporter,
and each project is associated with funding over multiple fiscal years
and mechanisms (e.g., through administrative supplements).</p>

<p>A unique aspect of the ITCR FOA structure is that it envisions
projects starting at one FOA and ‘maturing’ to the next FOA, e.g., an
<code>Early-Stage</code> U01 matures to an <code>Advanced</code> U24. It
is not possible to assess this by tracking a project number through full
FOA, because the project number changes with FOA. Are there projects
with the same contact PI that have received awards from different FOA
tags?</p>
