<p>The ‘grantpubcite’ package can be used to query the <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/" class="external-link">NIH Reporter</a> database for funded
grants, and the publications associated with those grants. The citation
history of publications can be discovered using <a href="https://icite.od.nih.gov/" class="external-link">iCite</a>.</p>
<p>In this case study we look at the Innovative Molecular Analysis
Technologies (<a href="https://imat.cancer.gov/funding-opportunities/funding-overview" class="external-link">IMAT</a>)
program aimed at the development andb integration of novel and emerging
technologies in the support of cancer research, diagnosis, and
treatment. We track funding opportunities from 2012 onward.</p>

</details><p>There are 3323 publications. One challenge with is that a large
project (e.g., U54MD000538) may have been funded throughf IMAT for only

Nonetheless, publications reflect the publication of the large project,
