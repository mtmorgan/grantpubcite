<p>The ‘grantpubcite’ package can be used to query the <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/" class="external-link">NIH Reporter</a> database for funded
grants, and the publications associated with those grants. The citation
history of publications can be discovered using <a href="https://icite.od.nih.gov/" class="external-link">iCite</a>.</p>
<p>In this case study we look at The Innovative Molecular Analysis
Technologies (<a href="https://imat.cancer.gov/funding-opportunities/funding-overview" class="external-link">IMAT</a>)
Program aimed at the development and integration of novel and emerging
technologies in the support of cancer research, diagnosis, and
treatment. We track funding opportunities from 2012 onward.</p>

</details><p>There are 3099 publications. One challenge with is that a large
project (e.g., U54MD000538) may have been funded throughf IMAT for only
a small amount of money or short period of time as a subproject.
Nonetheless, publications reflect the publication of the large project,
