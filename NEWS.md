# grantpubcite <0.0.1

## Bug fixes

- (v. 0.0.0.9005) Limit number of results returned by `reporter_*()`
  to 10,000; larger result sets have in my experience been the result
  of mis-specification of query criteria.

## User-visible changes

- (v. 0.0.0.9005) Add a short article exploring specific project
  numbers.

- (v. 0.0.0.9005) Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the
  package.
