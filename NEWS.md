# grantpubcite v0.0.1

- (v. 0.0.0.9009) Add missing FOAs (RFA-*) from 2019+; now 146 grants
    with more evidence of project maturation. Thanks to Satish
    Viswanath for pointing out the missing FOAs.

- (v. 0.0.0.9008) Add downloadable projects data. Thanks to Andrey
  Fedorov for comments leading to this and the preceeding change.

- (v. 0.0.0.9007) Add downloadable table of all ITCR publications /
  citations. Thanns

- (v. 0.0.0.9006) Provide higher-level narrative summary to 'Case
  study: ITCR' article.

- (v. 0.0.0.9005) Limit number of results returned by `reporter_*()`
  to 10,000; larger result sets have in my experience been the result
  of mis-specification of query criteria.

- (v. 0.0.0.9005) Add a short article exploring specific project
  numbers.

- (v. 0.0.0.9005) Add a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the
  package.
